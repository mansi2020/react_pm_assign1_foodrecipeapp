## Extra Packages Used
1. React: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
2. Axios: HTTP client for making API requests.
3. React Router: Library for routing in React applications.

## Learning from the Project
- Improved understanding of working with APIs in React applications.
- Enhanced knowledge of handling asynchronous operations using Axios.
- Strengthened proficiency in building responsive user interfaces with React.
- Utilized Axios for making HTTP requests.
- Leveraged React Router for navigation within the app.
- Employed the useReducer hook for managing state in complex components.
- Implemented responsiveness to ensure optimal viewing experience across different devices.

## Future Improvements Needed
1. Implement user authentication to allow users to save their favorite recipes or create custom recipe collections.
2. Enhance search functionality with filters, such as cuisine type or dietary restrictions.
3. Incorporate a rating system for recipes to help users find popular or highly-rated dishes.
4. Improve UI/UX design for a more visually appealing and intuitive user experience.
5. Optimize performance by implementing lazy loading for images or pagination for large recipe datasets.
6. Add offline support using service workers to allow users to access recipes even without an internet connection.
